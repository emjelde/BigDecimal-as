This directory is for benchmark results, comparing the original version of [ActionScript3 BigDecimal](http://code.google.com/p/bigdecimal/) and the current version provided by this project.

These were created with a separate benchmark app using [Grant Skinner's PerformanceTest v2 Beta](http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2010/02/performancetest.html), which I will publish later. 

This is a work in progress.

See the indivual files for results.
